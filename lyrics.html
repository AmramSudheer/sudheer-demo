            <pre>[Verse 1]
                You were the shadow to my light
                Did you feel us?
                Another star, you fade away
                Afraid our aim is out of sight
                Wanna see us alight
                
                [Pre-Chorus]
                Where are you now?
                Where are you now?
                Where are you now?
                Was it all in my fantasy?
                Where are you now?
                Were you only imaginary?
                
                [Chorus]
                Where are you now?
                Atlantis, under the sea, under the sea
                Where are you now? Another dream
                The monster's running wild inside of me
                I'm faded, I'm faded
                So lost, I'm faded, I'm faded
                So lost, I'm faded
                
                [Verse 2]
                These shallow waters never met what I needed
                I'm letting go, a deeper dive
                Eternal silence of the sea
                I'm breathing, alive

                Where are you now?
                Under the bright but faded lights
                You set my heart on fire
                Where are you now?
                Where are you now?
